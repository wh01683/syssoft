Project Instructions: 

Implement a program that demonstrates virtual memory page replacement algorithms, with user provided input. The implementation should include FIFO, Optimal, LRU at a minimum.

Compare the performance of these versions and provide an analysis of the results.

Conventions:

Editing: Whenever we make an edit, let's try our best to let others know what we did. i.e. what changes were made, what problems were solved/bugs were fixed, etc.

Commenting: We should comment code to make it clear for other users (naturally). However, I believe this is only truly necessary for code we write to follow complex algorithms.
