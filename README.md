Instructions on running (Linux):

1) Download all files and extract them into a folder

2) Run the run.sh file inside the folder containing the .cpp files with the following command:
	./run.sh

3) The test string in virtualPaging.cpp will be fed through and results from FIFO, LRU, WS, and Optimal
will be displayed in the console. These results include the total page fault tally and execution time in
milliseconds for each algorithm. The test string may be changed as desired through virtualPaging.cpp.
